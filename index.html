        <h2>Our Projects</h2>
        <div class="project">
            <img class="pro" src="./Assets/applsci-13-10675-g001.webp"/>
            <h3>Project 1: Autonomous Mobile Robot</h3>
            <p class="mem">This project involves designing and building a robot capable of navigating autonomously within an environment. The robot uses sensors like LIDAR, ultrasonic sensors, and cameras to map its surroundings and avoid obstacles. It is programmed with path planning algorithms to move from one point to another without human intervention.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="project">
            <img class="pro2" src="./Assets/robot arms.webp"/>
            <h3>Project 2: Robotic Arm</h3>
            <p class="mem">A robotic arm project focuses on creating a programmable arm that can perform tasks such as picking and placing objects, assembling components, or even performing intricate operations like soldering. The arm is controlled using servos and motors, and its movements are directed by software, which can be enhanced with machine learning for improved precision and efficiency.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="project">
            <img class="pro3" src="./Assets/line following.webp"/>
            <h3>Project 3: Line Following Robot</h3>
            <p class="mem">This simple yet popular project involves creating a robot that follows a predetermined path marked by a line on the ground. The robot uses infrared sensors to detect the line and adjusts its direction to stay on track. This project is a great way to learn about basic robotics concepts, sensors, and control systems.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="project">
            <img class="pro4" src="./Assets/drone.jpg"/>
            <h3>Project 4:  Drone (Quadcopter) Development</h3>
            <p class="mem">Developing a drone or quadcopter involves creating an aerial robot that can be remotely controlled or fly autonomously. The project covers aerodynamics, control systems, and sensor integration. Drones are used in various applications, including aerial photography, agriculture, delivery services, and environmental monitoring.</p>
